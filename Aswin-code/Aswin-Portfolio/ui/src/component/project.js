          facilitate asynchronous communication between microservices, ensuring
          reliable message delivery for notifications, appointment updates, and
          prescription generation. Wrote clean and modular JavaScript code to
          handle real-time user interactions, form validations, and dynamic data
          rendering for examination records.
